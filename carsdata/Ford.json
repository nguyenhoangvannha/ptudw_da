Now in its second generation, the Escape is more of a crossover than a traditional SUV. Technology, comfort, safety and fuel economy continue to be top priorities in the five-seat Escape thanks to a family of efficient four-cylinder engines (some turbocharged), optional four-wheel drive and advanced optional safety features, such as adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning and lane-keeping assist.
